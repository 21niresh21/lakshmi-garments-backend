Description:

The dependencies of some of the beans in the application context form a cycle:

   jobworkController defined in file [C:\Users\KEX1COB\Desktop\Personal\LG\lakshmi-garments-backend\target\classes\com\lakshmigarments\controller\JobworkController.class]
┌─────┐
|  jobworkServiceImpl defined in file [C:\Users\KEX1COB\Desktop\Personal\LG\lakshmi-garments-backend\target\classes\com\lakshmigarments\service\impl\JobworkServiceImpl.class]
└─────┘


Action:

Relying upon circular references is discouraged and they are prohibited by default. Update your application to remove the dependency cycle between beans. As a last resort, it may be possible to break the cycle automatically by setting spring.main.allow-circular-references to true.
